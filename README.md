Wildcard gives you a nice and simple to use interface to test/practice regular expressions.

## CI Build (Not recommended)

If you want to quickly test Wildcard you can grab the latest CI build [here](https://nightly.link/fkinoshita/Wildcard/workflows/flatpak/main).
Then you need to unzip the archive's content and install the application with the command `flatpak install wildcard.flatpak`.

## Code of conduct

Wildcard follows the GNOME project [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md). All
communications in project spaces, such as the issue tracker are expected to follow it.
